Linear Search runs at work linear time and makes at most N comparisons, where
N is the length of the list. Linear Search is rarely practical because other
search algorithms and schemes allow significantly faster searching for all
but SHORT lists.


ANALYSIS

Best Case: O(1) - They target is the first element
Average Case: Θ(n) - The target is equally likely to be in any position
Worst Case: O(n) / Θ(n) - Target not found or target is last element
