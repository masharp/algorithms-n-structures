Quick Sort, also known as Partition-Exchange Sort, is an efficient sorting algorithm.
When implemented well, can be about two or three times faster than Merge Sort and
Heap Sort. Quick Sort is a comparison sort and does not produce a stable sort.
It can operate in place on an array requiring small additional amounts of memory to
perform the sorting.

ANALYSIS

Worst Case: O(n^2) - If the pivot is the smallest or largest element in the array
Average Case: O(n log n)
Best Case: O(n log n) - The list is partitioned into two equal halves.
