## useful-algorithms & algorithm-challenges
Algorithms and data structures written by me to solve simple to complex problems.

Languages include Java, Python, JavaScript and a bit of Ruby. Some are pretty good,some are hacked together.  

My intention with this repo is to track my own progress, save solutions to problems for future use, and to potentially help others along the way.  


### Algorithms Include:
  * Sorting (QuickSort.js, MergeSort.js, etc.)
  * Searching (BinarSearch.js)
  * Data Structures (Trees.java, LinkedList.java, etc.)
  * Common Interview / Challenge Problems
  * My Solutions to [HackerRank](http://www.hackerrank.com) problem sets
