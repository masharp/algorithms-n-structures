Merge Sort is an efficient general-purpose comparison based sorting algorithm.
Most implementations produce a stable sort where the algorithm preserves the input
order of equal elements in the sorted output.  

Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that splits the array, sorts the
sub arrays, and then merges them to produce a result.  

###Analysis

Worst Case: O(n log n)  
Average Case: O(n log n) - Apply the algorithm to two lists of half size and add the n steps to merge  
Best Case: O(n log n)
