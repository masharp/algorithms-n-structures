Shell sort is a variation of insertion sort that gains speed by allowing exchanges
of elements that are far apart. Insertion Sort is slow on large data sets because
it only exchanges adjacent elements.

The idea is to rearrange the array to give it the property that taking the hth entry
yeilds a sorted subsequence (said to be hth-sorted).
