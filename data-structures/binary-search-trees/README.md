A Binary Search Tree keeps the keys in a sorted order so that the lookup and other
operations can use the binary search algorithm. This allows fast lookup, insertion
and removal of items. Traversal begins at the root and then compares each left/right
child leaf for the given relationship to the searched data (ie, left < x). This means
that generally only half of the tree is searched.
