A Queue data structure is a linear structure which outputs elements in the same
order in which they were input. The principle operations are adding an element
to the end of the Queue and removing an element from the from of the Queue. A
'peek' method also shows the first element without removing it.  

The Queue structure often acts as a buffer on elements that will be processed
at a later time.
